## Why?

Hello everyone! After quite some time thinking about starting a blog, and never actually doing it, I've decided to go ahead with it so that I can do my part in the community and share some things I've learned, with the hopes that it may be useful to others as well.

## A little bit about me

* Did a Computer Engineering course in Brazil. Mostly Java and Javascript with a bit of C, C++ and Python.
* Worked remotely for Process Street, doing Scala and Javascript. Check them out! Great product, and great place to work!
* Currently working with ClojureScript at GreenPowerMonitor. Great place as well, and quite willing to explore new grounds as seen by the usage of ClojureScript (and also F#).
* Can't really see myself going back to non functional programming languages.

## What am I going to be blogging about?

Only thing set in stone is that it's going to be programming related things. At the start that means mostly Clojure(Script), but as I experiment with other things they will end up here as well.
