A blog talking about programming related things that I face while developing and that I think worth sharing so that I can contribute to the community.

My hope is that I can share some knowledge which might not be anything new or ground breaking, but that can still be a step forward in providing some more resources to people who stumble on the same problems I do or that are just getting started with those things.
